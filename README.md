# Big-Data Heart Stroke Detection.

In our project we have built 4 models on our dataset- Logistic, Decision Tree, Random Forest Tree and Gradient Boosting Tree, and we found that the Gradient Boosting Tree model had the highest accuracy amongst all the 4 models and the model accuracies are summarized in the presentation.
